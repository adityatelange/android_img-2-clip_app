Utility to copy an image shared via [`Intent.ACTION_SEND`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_SEND) to clipboard using the Android Sharesheet.

## How It Works
When an image is shared using the `Intent.ACTION_SEND` intent (e.g., via a gallery app or browser), this utility captures the shared image and copies it to the clipboard for easy use in other applications.

> [!NOTE]  
> You'd see this app in app list but it won't be present in app drawer as it has no UI to it.
